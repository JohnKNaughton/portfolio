                1. The Demographic Turnaround
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                For centuries, the story of global population has been one of relentless, often exponential, growth. However, based on current projections, humanity is rapidly approaching a historic peak. Most models suggest the world population will reach its maximum—somewhere between 9.7 and 10.4 billion people—by the mid-2060s. After that, for the first time in modern history, the global headcount is expected to begin a slow, sustained decline. This shift marks a profound inflection point, moving global discourse from concerns of "overpopulation" to the challenges of "depopulation" and aging societies.

                This transition is not about resource limits, but changing human behavior, primarily driven by falling fertility rates worldwide.

                2. Why the Decline? The Total Fertility Rate (TFR)
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                The key to this demographic shift is the Total Fertility Rate (TFR)—the average number of children a woman is expected to have over her lifetime. The replacement rate, the TFR needed to maintain a stable population, is approximately 2.1. Crucially, the global TFR has been in steady decline for decades, fueled by increased access to education for women, better healthcare, urbanization, and contraception. Currently, more than half of the world's population lives in countries with a TFR below this replacement level.

                Countries like South Korea (TFR under 0.8) and Japan are leading the world into this low-fertility future, facing immediate challenges of shrinking workforces and strain on pension systems.

            </h2>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                The global average masks massive regional differences. Population growth remains robust in several regions, most notably Sub-Saharan Africa. Nations here still have relatively high fertility rates and young populations, driving the continued overall growth toward the peak. Meanwhile, developed nations and many parts of Asia are shrinking and rapidly aging. This divergence creates geopolitical and economic complexities: a young, growing, workforce-rich region on one side, and an aging, consumption-heavy, technologically advanced region on the other.

            </h2>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Demographers often use a 'population pyramid' to visualize age structure. Traditionally, this shape is wide at the bottom (many young people) and narrow at the top (few old people). In declining nations, this pyramid is inverting, becoming a 'column' or even a 'beehive,' wide in the middle and upper segments. This means fewer workers supporting more retirees, demanding radical reforms in healthcare, retirement age, and immigration policies.

                    The nations driving the population push toward the peak are characterized by high birth rates, reduced child mortality, and increased life expectancy. These countries face challenges related to infrastructure, education, and job creation for their rapidly expanding youth demographic.

                    Conversely, countries experiencing the steepest decline often struggle with low birth rates coupled with outward migration. Their primary issues revolve around economic productivity, supporting an aging consumer base, and managing vacant housing and infrastructure.
